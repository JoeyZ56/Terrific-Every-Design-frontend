Todo:
Project grid
sending image files to email address

Issues to fix:

1. check box form data not being regestered or
   not showing up as string name rather array number (priority) (fixed)

server not sending the email to the contractor (fixed)

ideas:

1. PDF FILE
   A. view through modal or have dedicated page to fill out form and sent to you

Notes For Ted:
Show basic set up with layout.
Show how data is sent from the form to email.
what form feilds do you want to be "required" to be filled out?
Does he want the project grid and job request count?
Logo?
